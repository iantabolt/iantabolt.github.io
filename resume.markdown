Apr 2017 - Jul 2021 | New York, NY

Places API: I worked on Foursquare's next generation <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">developer API</a>. Our APIs let developers use the same location technology and place data that power Foursquare's own apps. The API provides all endpoints needed to power a location search, including place search, autocomplete, and place details.

Developer Systems: Worked to improve Foursquare's developer tooling, including our build workflow (Pants), and core Scala libraries like <a href="https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio">Spindle and Rogue</a>, and the overall Scala ecosystem in our codebase, which is a monorepo comprised of millions of lines of Scala over thousands of packages.

Place Data Pipeline: Previously worked on our venue pipeline built on Hadoop, Scalding, and Spark. The pipeline ingested place records from first and third party sources, performed distributed clustering/conflation, and output a canonical view of the worldâ€™s places. This place output powered all of our apps internally as well as our developer APIs mentioned above.

I worked on the sports data API (Java 8/Spring/Couchbase), which was a originally developed for MLB, but our team adapted it to NHL, MLS, and other sports. This system served all of the stats and data that powered the streaming services, websites, and apps used by these leagues. Built a responsive job scheduling framework with Scala and Akka (Streams/Actors/HTTP).

Back-end Scala/Java/PHP software engineer at Cortx, a small company (~2 people at the time) creating NLP-powered tools used by SEOers for content creation needs as an alternative to freelance writers. While at Cortx, I built ArticleForge from scratch - an NLP pipeline that given one or more keywords, gathers relevant content and restructures it "in its own words" as a fresh article.
