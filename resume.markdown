### Work

#### <i class="fas fa-city fa-lg"></i> &nbsp;<a style="color:black" href="https://metropolis.io">Metropolis</a>
Jul 2021 - Present | New York, NY

Apr 2017 - Jul 2021 | New York, NY

Recently began work on the next generation <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">developer API</a>. Previously on our infra team focusing on Scala tooling and infrastructure of Foursquare, including our build workflow (Pants), and core Scala libraries like <a href="https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio">Spindle and Rogue</a>. I worked to improve the Scala ecosystem in our codebase, which is a monorepo comprised of millions of lines of Scala over thousands of packages.

Previously worked on our venue pipeline built on Hadoop, Scalding, and Spark. The pipeline ingested place records from first and third party sources, performed distributed clustering/conflation, and output a canonical view of the world's places.

Some recent projects:
 - Upgraded our codebase to Scala 2.12, after dozens of other third party
   library upgrades to ensure compatibility.
 - Migrated our Rogue library to use reactive streams instead of callback 
   hell for asynchronous MongoDB access.
 - Migrated our MongoDB clusters to a cloud-hosted solution, while avoiding
   data loss or downtime on the application side.
 - Integrated a Scala formatter into our codebase.
 - Refactored our Spindle Thrift codegen to significantly cut down on generated
   code.
 - Developed an onboarding project to guide new developers through monorepo
   setup and usage.
